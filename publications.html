    <H2>Abstract</H2> <em>A common device for the conversion of low- and medium-power to AC from DC energy
         applications is multilevel inverters (MLIs). The increasing number of semiconductor devices and the 
         circuit design, which increases total control complexity and raises the cost, are the main obstacles 
         to using multilevel designs. Multi-Level Inverters based on Switched-capacitor for boosting AC from 
         DC power conversions often negotiate with the quantity of switching devices and switch voltage, with 
         a decrease in one requiring a rise in the other. The switches in SCMLBI are controlled by the PWM 
         (pulse width modulation) technique.<br>
         <br>
         Typically, the value of Multi-level Inverters based on switched-
         capacitors (SCMLIs) is described using the term cost-effective function that includes variables such
         as, count of levels, component count, total standing voltage (TSV) and voltage gain. So, our work 
         is aiming to propose SC25LI topology with DC Voltage sources that has self-voltage balance of capacitors. Also, further the DC Voltage source can be replaced by Solar PV source. The proposed SC25LI will be validating through simulation results and also comparing with the existing SCMLI topologies.
